# Model Transformation and Code Generation - Using RM2PT

A Food App scenario model Transformation and code generation has been chosen. These are the objectives of lab (4):

1- Master the methods for model transformation using ATL or QVT plugins

2- Master the methods for model-to-code generation using Acceleo or Xtend plugins
## Model Transformation (ATL) Part:
The first part is to perform a model transformation of the chosen scenario. A simplified version of UML2 activity diagram to a UML State machine diagram.

## Code Generation (Acceleo) Part:
For the secon part, a code generation in a scenario of the chosen model. A Java code for the UML activity diagrams to generate Java code class diagrams that include the OOP principles. However, due to lack of understanding and inexperience, this task was unable to be completed.
