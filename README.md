# Model Transformation and Code Generation - Using RM2PT

A Food App scenario model Transformation and code generation has been chosen. These are the objectives of lab (4):

1- Master the methods for model transformation using ATL or QVT plugins

2- Master the methods for model-to-code generation using Acceleo or Xtend plugins
## Model Transformation (ATL) Part:
The first part is to perform a model transformation of the chosen scenario. A simplified version of UML2 activity diagram to a UML State machine diagram.

## Code Generation (Acceleo) Part:
For the secon part, a code generation in a scenario of the chosen model. A Java code for the UML activity diagrams to generate Java code class diagrams that include the OOP principles. Generation of the module from the UML model. Here, the manifest file is edited and run to generate the classes in Java code. The first step was to create a new simplified UML of my project using UMLDesigner by Eclipse. Then, using the UML the code was generated using Acceleo. This gave the structure to automatically generate the Java code such as methods and variables (UML to Java).
